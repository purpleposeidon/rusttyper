# rusttyper
Aims to provide sufficiently-featured font-rendering with `glium`. It's not there yet.
This code is based from the example in [rusttype](https://github.com/dylanede/rusttype/blob/9f9dbcd82d49f6bfc2a6658179b2d693745f4a53/examples/gpu_cache.rs)

Planned features:
- [x] Word-wrapping
- [ ] Fallback fonts
- [x] Styling (Bold, italic, underline, color)
- [ ] Icons & emoji
- [ ] LTR support
